# BlenderKeymap-Industry-Compatible-Navigation-and-Transform
_Note: I was used to other software navigation and transform so switching to Blender was a struggle. Couldn't change to their Industry Compatible keymap because it's not applicable when watching tutorials. I couldn't find a keymap that only changed these hotkeys, so here goes. Hope this help._

## This keymap adjusts some hotkeys for:

### 3D space navigation
Pan: Alt + Middle mouse <br />
Rotate: Alt + Left mouse <br />
Zoom: Alt + Right mouse<br />

### Object transform
Move: W <br />
Rotate: E <br />
Transform: R <br />
Scale: T _(press T again to cycle between Scale and Scale cage)_<br />

### Object select:
Select: Q <br />
_(press Q again to cycle between Tweak, Select box, Select circle, Select lasso)_<br />

### Image navigation
Pan: Alt + Middle mouse <br />
Zoom: Alt + Right mouse <br />
  
### UI on/off:
Left toolbar: Ctrl + [  <br />
Right resize region: Ctrl + ]  <br />

### Other hotkeys are based on Blender 4.0's keymap. <br />

## How to add keymap:
